title: How do I get LBRY credits?
---

There are currently three ways in which you can get LBRY credits, or LBC for short.

1. Beta testers get an LBC gift. Talk to us on [Slack](https://slack.lbry.io/) if
   you're interested.
1. Mine them: see [Mining](https://lbry.io/faq/mining-credits)
1. Host content: see [Hosting](https://lbry.io/faq/host-content) for details. Note that
   hosting requires the LBRY app, which is currently only open to beta testers.
1. Publish content: when you publish your own content to the LBRY network, you can sell it for LBC at the price of your choice.
