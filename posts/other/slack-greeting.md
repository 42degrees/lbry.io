Welcome to LBRY Slack! A few things for new users to know:

- LBRY is currently invite only - make sure you are on the list [here](https://lbry.io/get)!
- We will not give you an invite unless you demonstrate an ability to help or are a badass in some other way
- Keep it on topic (LBRY), outside of \#random
- Outside of the \#help channel, do not ask basic or beginner questions
- Your question may already be answered on the [FAQ](http://lbry.io/faq)
- Be courteous, kind, and generous or you're out
