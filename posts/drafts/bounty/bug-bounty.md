LBRY will award LBC for all cleanly documented bugs, security vulnerabilities, or other flaws in LBRY's software, servers, infrastructure, or procedures.

Awards will be variable based on the severity of the issue. Any discoveries that risk exploitation of the LBRY network, it's users, or LBRY Inc. should be disclosed privately to [grin@lbry.io](mailto:grin@lbry.io).

Extremely severe discoveries will warrant commensurate awards. Typical bug discoveries will be at the bottom of the scale.
