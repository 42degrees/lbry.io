LBRY currently maintains and runs a block explorer at [explorer.lbry.io/](https://explorer.lbry.io/).

This explorer is a fork of Iquidus Explorer and is [on Github](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-explorer).

Iquidus explorer is great, but does not currently support LBRY specific operations.

The explorer should be modified to:

- Display what LBRY name claims and supports
- Exploration of name claims in a way similar to transactions
