The current background images on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lbryio) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/lbryio) are the same stock photo
that is on our homepage. We'd like to do something a little more unique.

Candidate replacements could be either a photo or a graphic design. Either way, the image should:

- Connote what LBRY is about: openness and fun
- Be unique to LBRY or otherwise not in significant use
- Suitable for white or LBRY green (#155B4A) text on top
