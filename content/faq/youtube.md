To sync your existing channel to LBRY, use the sync process on the [LBRY.io YouTube Sync page](https://lbry.io/youtube).

Authenticating your YouTube channel and other information puts your content into a queue to be automatically mirrored on the LBRY network. This serves as an alternative to moving your entire channel by yourself. The content, its title and description, as well as thumbnails and other metadata, will sync to your channel name. When it is done, you will receive a notice from LBRY indicating your channel is available to view.

When you sync your channel, you are also eligible to receive LBRY Credits in our Partner Program based on your subscriber count. This is intended to be a monthly allotment for one year's time. The current implementation is a lump sum of LBRY Credits. Receiving these credits is subject to a one year agreement, and if you are in the United States, can be considered taxable income. [Please find the agreement here](https://lbry.io/faq/youtube-terms).
