title: How does content hosting work?
category: getstarted

Right now, it's simple: you host what you download.

While the LBRY app is running, it communicates to the network what
content you're making available. If somebody downloads content from
you, you will receive LBRY credits (LBC) for the data you  upload.

**Please note: Hosting fees are currently disabled on the network as we work on a better way to implement the fee structure**
