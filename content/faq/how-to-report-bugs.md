title: How do I get help or report a bug?
category: setup

For live help, please join [our chat](https://slack.lbry.io) and in channel #bugs post a note with what exactly is going on (details please!).

To report a bug (and assuming you're using the UI) click Help, then click the Send Us a Bug Report link.

If you're a developer or technical, you're welcome to open an issue [directly on GitHub](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/issues).
