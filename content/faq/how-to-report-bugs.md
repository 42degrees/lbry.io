For live help or to report a bug, please join [our chat](https://slack.lbry.io) and in the #help channel, post a detailed message with the issue you are experiencing. The more information you can provide, the better we can support!

To report a bug via the LBRY App, go to Help from the menu bar and then click the "Submit a Bug Report" button.

If you're a developer or technical, you're welcome to open an issue directly on GitHub - [Daemon related](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/issues) or [Application related](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-app/issues).  Please do a quick search in both repositories to see if a similar issue already exists.
