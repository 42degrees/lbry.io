category: What Makes LBRY Different?

Toasters transfer heat via radiative EM waves in the infrared spectrum to brown bread and make people happy.

LBRY transfers data via EM waves in the infrared spectrum* to deliver content and make people happy.

LBRY is also brave and little. So weâ€™re basically, fundamentally the same as a toaster.

**Assumes fiber-optic transmission.*
