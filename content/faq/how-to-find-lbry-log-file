In certain cases, we may ask you to send us your log file(s).  The current log file is titled `lbrynet.log` and is archived each time the files reaches 2MB. Older log files are copied to `lbrynet.log.<#>`. Typically only the lbrynet.log file is required, but we may ask for the others depending on the situation.  Since each Operating System has its own set of working directories, use the below guide in order to locate the log file(s).

 **lbrynet.log files may contain your IP address, so please mask it out before posting to public forums like Slack or Github**

## Windows

## MacOS
