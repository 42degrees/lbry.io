title: If I don’t want to deal with name auctions at all, what are my options?
category: LBRY 101

We don’t want to see the naming system scare off potential users. And if it fails to work as planned, we don’t want it to take down the whole LBRY project. 

Rest assured, we’re implementing permanent URLs that are **always yours**. You will have one link that contains all your LBRY content you can use in promotional materials or share online – just like a Youtube channel URL.

Using this approach, you can bypass the auction system entirely. You could even have a regular domain name, like www.jackscodingclass.com, point to all of your content on LBRY.

More details on this update will be released shortly. [Subscribe to our mailing list](https://lbry.io/get) to stay up to date.
