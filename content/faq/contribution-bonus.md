If you are viewing this page, it's most likely because we've noticed you made a contribution to the LBRY project. First of all, thank you! Every contribution, whether it's a good suggestion, a bug report or promotion, is crucial for the development and continued success of the LBRY application and network. Providing you with a tip, in LBRY Credits, is just a small token of appreciation for your time and effort in assisting LBRY.  The tip is completely optional and can be redeemed at your discretion. 

## How do I redeem my reward?
You already completed the hard part, so we'll try to make this as easy as possible. Simply send us an [email](mailto:help@lbry.io) with the link to your contribution and your LBC address.  If you don't have an address, download [LBRY](https://lbry.io/what) to create one. 

## I stumbled upon this page browsing the FAQ, how can I help?

We've compiled a [contributing guide](https://lbry.io/faq/contributing) which is a good place to begin poking around.
