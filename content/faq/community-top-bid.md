### What are Community Top Bids?

Community Top Bids are a public space on the LBRY application, where anyone can share content with the rest of the LBRY community based on the bidding process. Users can place bids in LBRY credits (LBC) on the names ranging from "one" to "ten" and put their content on the front page of the LBRY application. The names correspondent with the position of the content, placing it on positions 1 to 10 in the content bar. 
This mechanism enables users to promote their content and it is based on the LBRY naming system. The LBC are not lost, but just used as a deposit for the name claim.
