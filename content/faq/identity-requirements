### Why We Ask

LBRY controls millions of credits that it wants to get into the hands of content creators and content consumers.

Unfortunately, when you try to give stuff away for free, people will abuse it.

This, and only this, is the reason we require a credit card to participate in the rewards program. We wish we could tell you were a real person without this step, but no other solution we've tried thus far has worked well.

*To be clear, no money will be charged to your card nor or ever.* There is no fine print and there is no trick.

Your card information is submitted direclty to [Stripe](https://stripe.com), one of the largest credit card processors in the world.

### What If I Don't Want To Provide It?

No problem!

You are welcome to use the LBRY browser without providing any personal information. We just can't give you any rewards.

Note that without some credits, you will be unable to publish or access paid content.

However, you can get credits in lots of other ways. See [this article on purchasing and earning credits](https://lbry.io/faq/earn-credits).
