A lot of people won’t care about LBRY until it can deliver them immediate benefits. That’s fair and we understand.

The advantage of getting involved right now is the same as following a local band that you’d like to see make it big. You have the opportunity to have very direct contact with our dev team. You can make suggestions and shape the course of LBRY. You can [earn bounties](https://lbry.io/bounty) for helping to build and promote LBRY. You can connect with our truly amazing community of people, like [Javier from Venezuela who says LBRY gave him new hope for life](https://lbry.io/news/day-in-shoes-venezuelan). You can [post your content to the network](https://lbry.io/publish) before it is mainstream and get attention and appreciation from our early adopters – not to mention a possible prize of $1000 in LBC. 

Or get involved because it’s rare to get an opportunity to be part of a project that could reshape the fabric of the internet and creative media for years to come.
