title: How do I back up my wallet?
category: wallet
---

LBRY provides two different wallets, `lbryum` and `lbrycrd`. `lbryum` is the default wallet, but early versions came with `lbrycrd` as the default.

## Windows

Make a copy of the `C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\LBRYum\wallets` directory.

## MacOS and Linux

Make a copy of the `$HOME/.lbryum/wallets` directory.

## lbrycrd wallet

You may have a lbrycrd wallet if you used an early version of LBRY or if you ran `lbrycrdd` manually. Look for the `C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\lbrycrd` directory on Windows, or the `$HOME/.lbrycrd` directory on MacOS or Linux. If you have this directory, back up the `wallet.dat` file therein.
