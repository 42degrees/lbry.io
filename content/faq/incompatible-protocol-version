title: Incompatible Protocol Version Warning
category: troubleshooting
---

This warning happens when your LBRY browser did not install with the proper version of the software used to communicate with the LBRY network.

The most likely cause of this error is an old version was running during the install process.

### How to Fix

1. Restart LBRY.
1. If this did not work, restart your computer (or kill all processes with "lbry" in the name). Then restart LBRY.
1. If this did not work, re-install LBRY.

(do they need to do a full re-install? if you simply re-run the installer, will it update the daemon?)
