category: getstarted
---

Currently, there are five ways to obtain LBRY Credits, or LBC for short.

1. LBRY users get an LBC gift by way of in-app Rewards. Talk to us on [Slack](https://slack.lbry.io/) if
   you're interested in additional testing or helping the community. 
1. Buy them: see [Exchanges](/faq/exchanges)
1. Mine them: see [Mining](/faq/mining-credits).
1. Host content: see [Hosting](/faq/host-content) for details. Note that
   hosting requires downloading content and running LBRY on your PC. 
1. Publish content: when you publish your own content to the LBRY network, you can sell it for LBC at the price of your choice.
