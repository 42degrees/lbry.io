This guide provides answers to questions regarding what you may upload to the LBRY app and network, as well as how to report illegal or infringing content. To learn more about our DMCA producedures, please see our [DMCA article](https://lbry.io/faq/dmca). 

### What content can I legally upload to LBRY?

You may upload content you created or own that does not infringe on the rights of others or is illegal, or other content you have permission to upload. This includes Public Domain content, Creative Commons or Open Source content shared according to the license requirements, and Copyrighted content where you have permission from the owner.

### Because LBRY is decentralized, doesn't this mean the content can’t be removed?

It is important to make a distinction between the LBRY protocol and any applications running on top when referring to censorship. The LBRY protocol is fully decentralized and censorship-resistant, with it storing metadata and naming on the blockchain, and facilitating data transfers over a peer to peer (P2P) network. 

However, LBRY also makes an app to demonstrate our protocol. Within our app, we will engage in non-arbitrary censorship, meaning only horrific or infringing content will be removed. As a U.S. company, LBRY Inc. and management of our app, and other services in our control, will follow all U.S. laws, including the CDA and DMCA. If someone made an app or website using the LBRY protocol in some other country, it would have to follow that country's laws, which aren’t necessarily the same as ours. Either app would read the same blockchain, though. 

LBRY Inc., makes no guarantee your content will be hosted on the network. The peer-to-peer network relies on hosts to seed content. If no user continues to host data - including you, it will not continue to be available on the network.

### Someone uploaded my content to LBRY without permission. How do I remove it?

Reporting infringing/illegal content in the LBRY App is easy. You can [file a report here](https://lbry.io/dmca) or within the LBRY app. 

Open the LBRY App and navigate to the content you wish to report. Underneath the content, there are two buttons: "Download," and "Report." When you click on the Report button, you will be redirected to a web form to report the content to LBRY, Inc., who can remove the content link from the LBRY App. 

### What do I do if I see content that’s illegal or infringing in the LBRY App?

Please follow the FAQ above for reporting infringing content, and LBRY staff will review your report and take any appropriate action.
