# Introduction to LBRY Austen 1

Each LBRY app redesign[IS THIS TRUE? or MAJOR/MINOR VERSION?] will be named alphabetically after writers who’ve put work into the LiBraRY of classics and will have a post (like this one) discussing two things: 

1. LBRY’s connection of the writer "A Is For Austen, B Is For B___, etc." 

2. Information about the new features in each release: "About The ______ Release"

**A Is for Austen**

Jane Austen is one of the most prolific novelists of all time, best known for her work *Pride and Prejudice* in addition to *Sense and Sensibility. *

Austen’s literature was controversial in 19th century England for containing moral ambitions which were disagreeable, particularly the notion that wives should aspire to be more than mere proprietorial* *roomates for their husbands.

What happened to her novels?

They were banned. Not by YouTube, but by the parents of unmarried women. 

You may be wondering how she educated herself to write novels in such a patriarchal period of history.

Fortunately for us, Jane’s father George believed in education for all of his children so his daughters were encouraged to explore his LiBraRY. This enabled her to become well-read and eventually publish 6 novels.

Jane once said, *"What is right to be done cannot be done too soon."* 

The LBRY team agrees. That’s why we’re decentralizing content to provide controversial ideas with the freedom to flourish.

Some technologists will say, "The blockchain technology isn’t ready for content sharing yet, it’s too soon. "

We believe that creators should be able to monetize all of their work, no matter the social norms of the time.

 

Building a decentralized platform that provides creators with true freedom cannot be done too soon.

**About The Austen Release**

LBRY Austen is loaded with new features and aesthetics:

**1. ****Thumbnail Upload Button**

We’ve added a nifty little button that integrates [spee.ch](https://spee.ch) to keep your thumbnails on the decentralized LBRY blockchain with your content. Gone are the days of having to open a web browser to copy and paste image links for thumbnails. 

**2. View On Web Button**

Another nifty button that we’ve added is the "View on Web" button which enables you to watch free content in your web browser via spee.ch and share links to content via messaging and social media. 

**3. Autoplay Option**

We realized that most people don’t come to LBRY just to watch one video, which is why we added the option to automatically keep the content rolling.

**4. QR Code on Send & Receive Page**

We don’t speak QR code, but computers do. We decided to add a QR code for the public address (that’s the one you share with people for receiving tips and funds) on the Send & Receive Page. Those pixels will save you the time of typing in strings of random characters, after all, that’s time you could be watching or publishing content on LBRY!

**5. Publish ‘Pending…’ **

It’s nice to know the status of your publish. Beneath the title you’ll now see ‘Pending…’ if your publish isn’t yet confirmed.  Once your published content is confirmed on the blockchain, ‘Pending…’ disappears. Call it magic.

**6. Subscription Page Redesign**

People like to keep *up to date* with their favorite creators, so we’ve redesigned the Subscription page to show the latest content from their subscriptions instead of showing them per channel. Don’t worry, if you want to look at the latest content from each channel all you do is click on the channel name: channel pages work the same way.

**7. Improved Markdown Support**

Although a video is worth a million words, we made some improvements that allow creators to enhance their descriptions with enhanced markdown syntax. **Pretty** *cool *[right?](http://commonmark.org/help/)

**8****. Confirmation Prompt **

Money is power, and so is knowledge. The knowledge of what your funds are doing is ultra powerful. Now when you send credits from the LBRY app wallet you’ll be prompted with a confirmation screen to review the destination address and amount.
