## Hello LBRYians! 

**LBRY v0.21** is live, with some major updates to subscriptions and seriously improved search functionality.

![Subscriptions](https://spee.ch/f/subs-app-drk.png)

A popup explaining how subscriptions work now appears when users first subscribe to a channel, and subscribing will auto-download most recent content as well as any new content posted to the channel.
Users will also get a popup notification when a new video is added to a channel they're subscribed to.

We've upgraded the LBRY Protocol from version 0.18.2 to 0.19.1., which should improve reliability and help download performance and a number of other back-end processes.

You can read the [full release notes here](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-app/releases). And if you haven't downloaded the app yet, [what are you waiting for](lbry.io/get)?
