      <h3>What's going on here?</h3>
      <p>LBRY is a departure from the platforms of yesterday.</p>
      <p>Watch The Rubin Report YouTube Week on the only community-run video app without ads or middlemen.</p>
      <p>We're a bunch of nerds working on a cool project that we think college students might really like.</p>
      <p>If the students we talk to more than just like it, we want to support them in spreading the word around their campus.</p>
      <h3>Okay. But why?</h3>
      <p>Open-source and decentralized, LBRY is shaped entirely by the creators and community who use it. <b>Free speech and censorship-resistance are baked into the design.</b></p>
        <p>There are lots of nifty aspects to how LBRY works (pronounced, "library"). Learn from the old-timers on <a href="https://chat.lbry.io"><u>our Discord</u></a>.</p>
