          Jimmy is the second member of team LBRY to graduate from Rensselaer with degrees in computer science and physics.
          After, he found himself mired in government bureaucracy, spending too much time to get too little done.

        <p>
          Ready to work on a project he believed in, Jimmy left a national security programming job to start LBRY.
          Jimmy created the LBRY protocol and the first LBRY application.
